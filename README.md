# ReelPlaces

Have you ever wandered around whilst on holiday or on your way to work and wondered what momentous and cringey movie scene was filmed on the patch of ground you stood on? 

For those Star Wars movie buffs scouring the Tunisian desert in search of Totooine or the wide-eyed tourist in central London who stumbles upon the multitude of filming locations, your answer is here.

We created an app where users can search by location and discover which movies and tv series were filmed in that city, if the movie or tv series is in the IMDb Top250, you will be able to view a map with markers around the city.

## MVP
We began by mind-mapping multiple ideas and potential features, narrowing down our Minimum Viable Product which was being able to search for a location and view the list of movies correlating to that location.

For our MVP, we would like our app to acheive the following user stories:

```
As a user,
So I can search for the location, 
It should have a home page with a search bar.  
```
```
As a user,
So I can see the movies,
It should be able to show up on the home page.
```
```
As a user,
So I can see the movies information,
It should be able to show up on the movie info page.
```
```
As a user,
So I can see where it is filmed,
It should include a map.
```

As we completed the above, we started to build our product up feature by feature until we ended up with an app we were all proud of.
